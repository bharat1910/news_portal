The Lebanese government has confirmed that former Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri has died in a massive car bombing earlier today in downtown Beirut. Harare was viewed by many as the country's most prominent politician. The self-made billionaire led Lebanon for most of the period since the civil war ended in 1990. He left office in October after a dispute over Syria's role in Lebanon. Hariri made his fortunes as personal contractor for Prince Fahd in Saudi Arabia. At least nine others died in the car bombing that occurred in front of the famous St. George Hotel.
