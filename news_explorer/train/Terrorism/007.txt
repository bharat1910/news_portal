This comes as the Guardian newspaper is reporting that the number of suicide attacks in Iraq has reached a record high, with more than 67 resistance fighters blowing themselves up in the month of April alone. Citing figures from diplomatic and Iraqi security sources, The Guardian says that of the 135 car bombings in April, more than half were suicide missions. That's double the number in March. Meanwhile, a US military spokesperson in Iraq said the resistance was averaging 70 attacks a day this month, up from 30 to 40 in February and March.
