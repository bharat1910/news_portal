Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez blasted Washington for only charging him with an immigration violation, saying not extraditing him would amount to sheltering a terrorist. In a televised speech in Venezuela, Chavez said "The CIA knew those lords of death were going to put the bomb on the Cuban plane.'' Posada holds Venezuelan citizenship and the bombing was allegedly plotted in Caracas. What Chavez was referring to was a declassified State Department intelligence brief made public on Wednesday that says that an informant claimed that Posada said weeks before the bombing. "We are going to hit a Cuban airliner.'' Another declassified CIA document said the agency had a report from an informant in June 1976 that a group headed by Posada's associate Orlando Bosch planned "to place a bomb on a Cubana Airline flight traveling between Panama and Havana." Chavez also made clear that Venezuela would not hand Posada over to Cuba if the US fulfills its obligations. The US has said it will not extradite Posada to a country that "works on behalf of Cuba."
