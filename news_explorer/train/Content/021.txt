Suspected Cuban terrorist Luis Posada Carriles was charged yesterday with illegally entering the United States and faces an immigration hearing on June 13. But the US has made it clear it does not intend to extradite Posada to Venezuela where he faces prosecution on terror charges. Venezuela has officially demanded that the US hand him over in connection to the 1976 bombing of a Cubana airlines flight that killed 73 people, including the entire Cuban fencing team.
