In Washington, Senator Christopher Dodd has called on John Bolton to withdraw his name to become ambassador to the United Nations. Dodd - a Democrat from Connecticut-said, "He would do himself, and I think the country, a favor by withdrawing." Dodd's comment comes as new allegations surface over Bolton's qualifications for the post. Newsweek is reporting that in November 2003 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw personally complained about Bolton to then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell. Straw accused Bolton on making it impossible to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear program. In addition, Newsweek reports that high-ranking British officials successfully persuaded the Bush administration to keep Bolton off the team working to negotiate with Libya.
