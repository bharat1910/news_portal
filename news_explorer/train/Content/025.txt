We begin in Iraq, where at least 21 people were killed and more than 70 wounded yesterday in another wave of resistance attacks. In the past 24 hours alone, at least five US soldiers have been killed and more than a dozen injured. Four of those soldiers were killed near the Syrian border where US troops have encountered stiff resistance since launching an offensive there a week ago. Several car bombs exploded in Baghdad, with the worst killing 17 people in the east of the capital.
