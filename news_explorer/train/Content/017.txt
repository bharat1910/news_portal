In Washington President Bush called the election a "resounding success." He said "The world is hearing the voice of freedom from the center of the Middle East."  Meanwhile former presidential candidate John Kerry questioned the election's legitimacy. He told Tim Russert on Meet the Press "It is hard to say that something is legitimate when whole portions of the country can't vote and doesn't vote."
