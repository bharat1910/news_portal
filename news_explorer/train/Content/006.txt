In other Tsunami news, U.N. officials also said they were worried that orphaned or lost children might be falling prey to criminal gangs bent on selling them into slavery, adding to worries about a "tsunami generation" of children also under threat of disease and hunger. They had received reports - so far unsubstantiated - of adults posing as foster parents and children being shipped from Indonesia to Malaysia for sale. Children are the biggest victims of the disaster. They make up a third - 50,000 - of the dead. Tens of thousands more have been orphaned. The World Health Organization estimated more than half a million people were injured and in need of medical care in six nations. Fears grew that diseases such as cholera and malaria would break out among the five million displaced.
