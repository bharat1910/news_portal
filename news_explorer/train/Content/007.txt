In New Orleans, Mayor Ray Nagin has ordered law enforcement to forcibly remove any residents remaining in the city. Fires continue to spread in the city and fear is growing over the toxicity of the floodwater. Officials have announced that they plan to temporarily take all corpses to Saint Gabriels, a small town once used as a leper colony. Mayor Nagin warned that horrific sights would be seen once the city is drained of the floodwater. He said, "It's going to be awful and it's going to wake the nation up again."
